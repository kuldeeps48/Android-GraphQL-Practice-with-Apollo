# Android GraphQL Practice with Apollo
Practice Project to learn GraphQL using Apollo library for Android.

Uses https://3wzp7qnjv.lp.gql.zone/graphql as public endpoint.
Shows Movies and their details.

Ignore stupid names as some files(Adapters, util) where copied from other projects which I created previously.
